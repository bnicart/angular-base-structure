The angular file structure I use

#NOTES:
  Controller's file names are just as is, without affixes, but Controller's name has suffixes.
    e.g. FILE: controllers/contact.js
         Controller name: contactController

  Service's file names are just as is, without affixes, but Service's name is Capitalized.
    e.g. FILE: services/contact.js
         Service name: Contact
