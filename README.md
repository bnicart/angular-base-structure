The angular file structure I use

##Notes:
Controller's file names are just as is, without affixes, but Controller's name has suffixes.
```
File name: controllers/contact.js
Controller name: contactController
```
Service's file names are just as is, without affixes, but Service's name is Capitalized.
```
File name: services/contact.js
Service name: Contact
```
Directive's file names are just as is, without affixes and each word in the name is hyphenated, but Directive's name is Camel-cased.
```
File name: directives/contact-card.js
Directive name: ContactCard
```
