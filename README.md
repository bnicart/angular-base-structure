The angular file structure I use

##Notes:
Controller's file names are just as is, without affixes, but Controller's name has suffixes.
```
File name: controllers/contact.js
Controller name: contactController
```

Service's file names are just as is, without affixes, but Service's name is Capitalized.
```
File name: services/contact.js
Service name: Contact
```
